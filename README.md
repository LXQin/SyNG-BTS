# SyNG-BTS: Synthesis of Next Generation Bulk Transcriptomic Sequencing,

## What is it

SyNG-BTS is a data augmentation tool synthesizing transcriptomics data with realistic distributions without relying on a predefined formula. Three deep generative models are considered, incluing Variational Auto Encoder (VAE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and flow-based generative model. Those models will be trained on a pilot dataset and then utilized to generate data for any desired number of samples. The workflow of SyNG-BTS is depicted in the following figure:
